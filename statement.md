# Library Management System – Project Statement

## 🔹 Problem Statement
Managing books in a library manually becomes difficult as the number of books and students increases. Tasks like adding new books, keeping track of availability, issuing books, and returning them can take a lot of time and often lead to mistakes.  
To solve this problem, we need a simple software system that can help librarians or students manage books efficiently.

## 🔹 Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes developing a basic console-based Java application that helps manage a small library’s day-to-day operations.  
The system will allow the user to:
- Add new books into the system  
- View all available books  
- Issue books to students  
- Return issued books  
- Maintain simple inventory count  

The project focuses on core functionalities and does not include advanced authentication, database integration, or GUI. However, the design will be modular so that new features can be added easily in the future.

## 🔹 Target Users
- Students who want to search or issue books  
- Librarians who want to maintain book records  
- Educational institutions with small internal libraries  

This system is ideal for academic environments where quick access and simple operations are needed.

## 🔹 High-Level Features
1. **Add Book Module** – Allows the user to add new books by providing ID, name, author, and quantity.  
2. **View Books Module** – Displays all books currently stored in the system.  
3. **Issue Book Module** – Decreases quantity when a user issues a book.  
4. **Return Book Module** – Increases quantity when a book is returned.  
5. **Simple Menu Navigation** – A user-friendly console interface for performing all actions.

## 🔹 Additional Notes
- The system follows Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
- The design supports modularity, scalability, and easy maintainability.  
- Can be enhanced later with GUI or database storage.
